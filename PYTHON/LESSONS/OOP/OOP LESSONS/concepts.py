# Strong foundation of OOP using Python 
#Class - Objects - Properties - Actions

# Examples:
# Class and Objects = Electronics( TV - Fridge - Mobile Phone) 
# Class and Objects = Furniture(Sofa, Table, Chair)
# Class and Objects = Health Centre(Hospital, Pharmacy, Laboratory)
# Foundations necessary for OOP = Functions, Loops, Conditions, Data Structures


# Methods and Properties 

# Methods are functions in a class 
# Property is a variable in a class
# A Property and Method must be linked to an object to work

# Turtle Example

from turtle import  * 

t1 = Turtle()
#t2 = Turtle()
#t1.color("orange")
#t2.color("purple")
#
#t1.forward(50)
#t1.left(90)
#
#t2.left(90)
#t2.forward(50)

#done()

t1.color("orange")
t1.width(5)

t1.begin_fill()
for i in range(5):
    t1.forward(150)
    t1.left(144)
t1.end_fill()


done()

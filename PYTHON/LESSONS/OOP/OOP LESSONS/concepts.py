# Strong foundation of OOP using Python 
#Class - Objects - Properties - Actions

# Examples:
# Class and Objects = Electronics( TV - Fridge - Mobile Phone) 
# Class and Objects = Furniture(Sofa, Table, Chair)
# Class and Objects = Health Centre(Hospital, Pharmacy, Laboratory)
# Foundations necessary for OOP = Functions, Loops, Conditions, Data Structures


# Methods and Properties 

# Methods are functions in a class 
# Property is a variable in a class
# A Property and Method must be linked to an object to work
